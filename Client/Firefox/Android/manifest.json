	"description": "Synchronizes in real time open tabs between browsers on different machines.\n\nThe main use case for the application is:\nAs a Internet user\nI want to have the same tabs open on my desktop and tablet browser\nSo that I can anytime continue reading at the point I had left without wasting my time for manual opening of tabs.\n\nIt's a self host solution which means that to use the utility you need to host the server yourself. This allows you to keep a maximum privacy as the history of your browsing does not leave your local network at the expense of maintaining your own server which needs to be online for synchronization.",
